# !! This weeks meeting was moved to Friday (OCT 17th) on Zoom !!

## Agenda for today:

1)  Double check and ensure that the "tidy" table is organized properly for analysis
2)  Finalize a rough research question (start broad and branch out to specialized topics)
3)  If green lights for data, go overall relevant codes needed to be done before proposal deadline (OCT 26TH!!)
4)  Confirm research question (main question at least) and possibly discuss the sub-topics that can be analyzed using the data available
5)  Go over any relevant questions in preparation for troubleshooting over the weekends

-   *side note: Why did a gitignore file appear in the directory? Is the gitignore file important or can I delete it?*

## Team Meeting Notes (Date: 10/17/2025):
The research questions can be general for now, and can be refined as more literatures are being reviewed.
## To-Do List:

-   Complete pre-proposal (due OCT 19th)
